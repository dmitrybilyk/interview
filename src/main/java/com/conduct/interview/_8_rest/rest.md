# REST (Representational State Transfer)

**REST** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It
relies on standard HTTP methods like **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and
**DELETE** to manage resources, which are identified by **URIs**.

### Key Features:
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all necessary information, with no
  server-side session.
- **Client-Server**: Separation of client (UI) and server (data handling).
- **Cacheable**: Responses can be marked as cacheable to improve performance.
- **Uniform Interface**: Consistent, predictable structure for requests and
  responses.
