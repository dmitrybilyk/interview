✅ How to Explain Your DB Design
🧱 1. Modular Structure
"I designed the schema in a modular way: each table has a specific responsibility.
For example, rules define what we evaluate, attribute_sub_rules define how we break it down,
and automated_reviews store the actual evaluation results."

🔄 2. Normalization
"I followed database normalization principles, mostly up to the third normal form (3NF).
That means:

Each table stores only one type of entity (e.g., rules, scores, tags).

Repeating groups are extracted into separate tables (e.g., multi_equals, range).

Foreign keys connect related data instead of duplicating values."

Simple example:
Instead of putting sub-rule data inside automated_reviews, I placed it in attribute_sub_score
and linked it with foreign keys — this reduces redundancy and improves consistency.

🔑 3. Primary Keys & Foreign Keys
"Each table has a clear primary key (id) and all relationships use foreign keys.
This ensures data integrity and enforces valid links between related tables."

Examples:

attribute_sub_rules.rule_id → rules.id

speech_tags.attribute_sub_rule_id → attribute_sub_rules.id

🧩 4. Flexible Scoring System
"Scoring is flexible:

Each sub-rule can have different score types: fixed (score), ranges, or multi-equals values.

This allows us to build a flexible rule engine, where each sub-rule type is pluggable."

🧠 5. AI Integration
"For AI-based evaluations, we have ai_questions linked to sub-rules.
Each question maps to yes/no/NA scores. This makes AI results compatible
with the same rule-based evaluation logic."

🕐 6. Execution History & Retries
"I store each execution (executions) with stats like number of records, success/fail counts.
If something goes wrong, retry table tracks when and how many times a rule was retried."

📊 7. Auditability and Traceability
"Everything is traceable:

Which rule was applied

Which sub-rule triggered

What the AI answered

What the score was

Whether we used speech tags or metadata"

This allows full transparency and explainability, which is critical for QM systems.

✅ Best Practices I Followed
Use normalized tables to avoid redundancy

Use foreign keys to maintain integrity

Ensure expandability (e.g., subrules can have many types)

Store execution history for audit/debug

Keep AI & rule-based evaluations unified

Use clear naming conventions

Avoid storing computed or redundant fields (keep logic in app/service layer)

🧠 Summary You Can Say at Interview:
"I designed the database using normalization principles (up to 3NF), with modular tables,
foreign key relationships, and traceable scoring logic. It supports flexible rule-based
and AI-driven evaluation with full transparency and auditability."







📚 Normal Forms (With Simple Examples)
🔹 1st Normal Form (1NF) – No repeating groups
Rule: Every column should contain atomic (single) values. No lists or arrays in a cell.

✅ Good:

ID	Phone
1	+38012345

❌ Bad:

ID	Phones
1	+38012345, +38067890

"In my DB, every field like agent_id, conversation_id, etc., stores only one value per row."

🔹 2nd Normal Form (2NF) – Remove partial dependencies
Applies only to tables with composite primary keys

Rule: Every non-key column must depend on the whole primary key, not just part of it.

✅ Good:
Split into:

Order(id, customer_id)

OrderItem(order_id, product_id, quantity)

"In my DB, each table has a single primary key (like id) and all columns describe that row only."

🔹 3rd Normal Form (3NF) – Remove transitive dependencies
Rule: Columns should only depend on the primary key, not on other non-key columns.

❌ Bad:
| EmployeeID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |

Here, DepartmentName depends on DepartmentID, not on EmployeeID directly.

✅ Good:
Split into:

Employee(id, department_id)

Department(id, name)

"In my schema, instead of putting everything into one table like automated_reviews, I created
separate tables for sub-rules, speech tags, ranges, and so on. Each table stores only its specific
piece of information and links to others through foreign keys."

🎯 Final Sentence You Can Say
"By normalizing up to 3NF, I made sure the database is clean, avoids duplication, and is easier
to maintain and scale. Every table has a clear purpose, and related data is connected using foreign keys.
That keeps everything organized and consistent."




Where to add indexes:

Foreign key	✅ Yes	Used in joins
WHERE clauses	✅ Yes	Speeds up filtering
JOIN conditions	✅ Yes	Essential for performance
ORDER BY columns	✅ Optional	If sorting is common
Composite filters	✅ Optional	For multi-column filters
