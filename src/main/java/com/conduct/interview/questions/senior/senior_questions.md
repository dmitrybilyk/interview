# Advanced Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Core Java (JVM, Classloading, Bytecode, Performance Optimization)

### Q1: What is Java language in your vision?
**Answer:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented, statically typed programming language designed for platform 
independence through its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability. It compiles source code into bytecode, 
which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing it to run on any system with a JVM installed.

---

### Q2: What does "Object-Oriented" mean?
**Answer:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances 
of classes. Objects encapsulate data (fields/attributes) and behavior (methods), promoting modularity, reusability, 
and maintainability.

---

### Q3: What does "Statically Typed" mean?
**Answer:** In a statically typed language like Java, variable types are checked at compile time. You must declare 
a variable's type before using it, and that type cannot change during runtime.

---

### Q4: Why is Java considered a strong programming language?
**Answer:**
- **Platform Independence**: Runs on any JVM-enabled system.
- **Robust and Secure**: Features like garbage collection, exception handling, and strong typing reduce errors.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and JavaFX enhance development.
- **Multithreading**: Built-in support for concurrency (e.g., Thread, ExecutorService).
- **Scalability**: Widely used in enterprise, microservices, and cloud solutions.
- **Community**: Extensive libraries and open-source support.

---

### Q5: What is the JVM, and how does it work?
**Answer:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode on any platform. It consists of:
- **ClassLoader**: Loads `.class` files into memory.
- **Runtime Memory Areas**: Heap (objects), Stack (method calls), Method Area (class metadata), etc.
- **Execution Engine**: Interprets bytecode or compiles it using the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
- **Garbage Collector**: Frees unused memory.

**Example:**
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
The JVM loads `HelloWorld.class`, verifies bytecode, allocates memory, and executes it.

---

### Q6: What is Java bytecode, and how does it ensure platform independence?
**Answer:** Bytecode is an intermediate representation of Java code (`.class` files) generated by the `javac` compiler. 
The JVM interprets or compiles it into native machine code, ensuring platform independence.  
**Example:**
```sh
javac HelloWorld.java  # Generates HelloWorld.class
java HelloWorld        # Executes on JVM
```

---

### Q7: What are the benefits of the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler?
**Answer:**
- **Performance**: Converts hotspot bytecode to native code for faster execution.
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Focuses on frequently used methods.
- **Better than Interpretation**: Compiles once, reuses native code.
- **Code Inlining**: Eliminates method call overhead.
- **Loop Unrolling**: Reduces loop iterations for efficiency.

---

### Q8: How does the ClassLoader work in the JVM?
**Answer:** The ClassLoader loads `.class` files into memory using a delegation model:
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: Loads core Java classes (e.g., `java.lang`).
- **Extension ClassLoader**: Loads classes from the `jre/lib/ext` directory.
- **Application ClassLoader**: Loads classes from the classpath.  
  It ensures classes are loaded only once and follows a parent-first delegation hierarchy.

---

## 2. OOP, SOLID, and Design Patterns

### Q9: What are the four pillars of OOP? Provide examples.
**Answer:**
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods, restricting access.  
   **Example:**
   ```java
   class Person {
       private String name;
       public String getName() { return name; }
       public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
   }
   ```
2. **Abstraction**: Hides complexity, exposing only essentials.  
   **Example:**
   ```java
   abstract class Shape {
       abstract double area();
   }
   ```
3. **Inheritance**: Reuses code via a parent-child relationship.  
   **Example:**
   ```java
   class Dog extends Animal {
       void bark() { System.out.println("Woof"); }
   }
   ```
4. **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to respond differently to the same method call.  
   **Example:**
   ```java
   class Cat extends Animal {
       void sound() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
   }
   ```

---

### Q10: What are Association, Aggregation, and Composition?
**Answer:**
- **Association**: A general relationship between objects (e.g., a teacher and a student).
- **Aggregation**: A "has-a" relationship with loose coupling (e.g., a car has wheels).
- **Composition**: A stronger "has-a" relationship where the child’s lifecycle depends on the parent (e.g., a house 
- has rooms).

**Example:**
```java
class Car { List<Wheel> wheels; }  // Aggregation
class House { List<Room> rooms; }  // Composition
```

---

### Q11: What are the SOLID principles? Provide an SRP violation example.
**Answer:**
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**SRP Violation:**
```java
class Invoice {
    void calculateTotal() { /* Logic */ }
    void printInvoice() { /* Logic */ }  // Should be in a separate class
}
```
**Fix:**
```java
class InvoicePrinter {
    void printInvoice(Invoice invoice) { /* Logic */ }
}
```

---

### Q12: Explain the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) with an example.
**Answer:** High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.  
**Example:**
```java
interface Database {
    void save(String data);
}
class MySQL implements Database {
    public void save(String data) { /* MySQL logic */ }
}
class App {
    private Database db;
    public App(Database db) { this.db = db; }  // Depends on abstraction
}
```

---

### Q13: How do primitive types and objects differ in parameter passing?
**Answer:**
- **Primitive Types** (e.g., `int`): Passed by value; changes don’t affect the caller.
- **Objects**: Reference is passed by value; changes to the object affect the original, but reassigning the reference 
- does not.

---

### Q14: What are Lambda Expressions, and how do they relate to Streams?
**Answer:** Lambda expressions (introduced in Java 8) provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces. 
They work with Streams for functional-style operations on collections.  
**Example:**
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);
```

---

### Q15: What are the most useful design patterns? Provide examples.
**Answer:**
- **Singleton**: Ensures one instance.
  ```java
  class Singleton {
      private static Singleton instance;
      private Singleton() {}
      public static Singleton getInstance() {
          if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton();
          return instance;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Factory Method**: Defers object creation.
  ```java
  interface Shape { void draw(); }
  class ShapeFactory {
      Shape getShape(String type) {
          if (type.equals("Circle")) return new Circle();
          return new Rectangle();
      }
  }
  ```
- **Observer**: Notifies objects of state changes.
  ```java
  class Subject {
      List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
      void notifyObservers() { observers.forEach(o -> o.update()); }
  }
  ```

---

### Q16: Explain the Command Pattern and its use cases.
**Answer:** Encapsulates a request as an object, decoupling sender and receiver.
- **Use Cases**: Undo/redo, queuing requests, logging.  
  **Example:**
```java
interface Command { void execute(); }
class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;
    public LightOnCommand(Light light) { this.light = light; }
    public void execute() { light.turnOn(); }
}
```

---

## 3. Concurrency and Multithreading

### Q17: What are the ways to create a thread in Java?
**Answer:**
1. **Extending Thread**:
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }
   }
   new MyThread().start();
   ```
2. **Implementing Runnable**:
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() { System.out.println("Runnable running"); }
   }
   new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();
   ```
3. **Executor Framework**:
   ```java
   ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
   executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Thread running"));
   executor.shutdown();
   ```

---

### Q18: How do you prevent race conditions in Java?
**Answer:** Use synchronization mechanisms:
- **`synchronized`**:
  ```java
  class Counter {
      private int count = 0;
      public synchronized void increment() { count++; }
  }
  ```
- **`ReentrantLock`**:
  ```java
  class Counter {
      private int count = 0;
      private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
      public void increment() { lock.lock(); try { count++; } finally { lock.unlock(); } }
  }
  ```
- **Atomic Variables**:
  ```java
  class Counter {
      private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
      public void increment() { count.incrementAndGet(); }
  }
  ```

---

### Q19: What is a deadlock, and how can it be prevented?
**Answer:** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.
- **Prevention**:
   - Use consistent lock ordering.
   - Use `tryLock()` with timeouts.
   - Minimize lock usage with tools like `ConcurrentHashMap`.

---

## 4. Spring & Dependency Injection

### Q20: What are the types of Dependency Injection in Spring?
**Answer:**
- **Constructor Injection**: For mandatory dependencies.
  ```java
  @Component
  class UserService {
      private final UserRepository userRepository;
      @Autowired
      public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) { this.userRepository = userRepository; }
  }
  ```
- **Setter Injection**: For optional dependencies.
- **Field Injection**: Not recommended (hard to test).

---

### Q21: How does Spring’s Dependency Injection improve design?
**Answer:** It promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies via interfaces rather than hardcoding implementations, 
enhancing testability and flexibility.

---

## 5. Hibernate (Caching, N+1, Performance Tuning)

### Q22: What is the N+1 problem in Hibernate, and how do you fix it?
**Answer:** Occurs when fetching each entity triggers separate queries for related entities.
- **Fix**: Use `JOIN FETCH` or `@BatchSize`.
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT u FROM User u JOIN FETCH u.orders")
  List<User> findAllUsersWithOrders();
  ```

---

### Q23: How does Hibernate caching work?
**Answer:**
- **First-Level Cache**: Session-specific, enabled by default.
- **Second-Level Cache**: Shared across sessions, requires configuration (e.g., Ehcache).

---

## 6. Security (Spring Security, Common Vulnerabilities)

### Q24: What are common web security threats, and how do you mitigate them?
**Answer:**
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries.
  ```java
  @Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email = :email")
  User findByEmail(@Param("email") String email);
  ```
- **XSS**: Escape user input.
- **CSRF**: Use CSRF tokens in Spring Security.
- **Broken Authentication**: Enforce strong passwords and session management.

---

## 7. Java Exceptions

### Q25: What is an exception in Java?
**Answer:** An event that disrupts normal program flow, represented by a `Throwable` object.
- **Checked Exceptions**: Must be handled (e.g., `IOException`).
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: Runtime errors (e.g., `NullPointerException`).

---

## 8. Java Collections Hierarchy

### Q26: Explain the Java Collections Hierarchy.
**Answer:**
- **`Collection`**: Root interface.
   - **List**: Ordered, allows duplicates (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`).
   - **Set**: No duplicates (e.g., `HashSet`, `TreeSet`).
   - **Queue**: Ordered for processing (e.g., `PriorityQueue`).
- **`Map`**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`, `TreeMap`).

---

### Q27: Compare `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` performance.
**Answer:**
- **ArrayList**:
   - Access: `O(1)`
   - Insert/Delete: `O(n)`
   - Best for random access.
- **LinkedList**:
   - Access: `O(n)`
   - Insert/Delete: `O(1)`
   - Best for frequent modifications.

---

### Q28: How does `HashMap` work internally?
**Answer:**
- Uses an array of `Node<K, V>` (buckets).
- **Insertion**: `put(K key, V value)` computes `hash(key)` and places it at `index = (array.length - 1) & hash`.
- **Collision**: Handled via linked lists (pre-Java 8) or red-black trees (Java 8+).
- **Resizing**: Doubles size when load factor (0.75) is exceeded.


What is a Collision? 

A collision happens when:

Two distinct keys, say key1 and key2, are passed through the hash function.
The hash function returns the same index for both keys (e.g., hash(key1) == hash(key2)).
The hashmap must then resolve this conflict to store and retrieve both key-value pairs correctly.

---

## 9. Java Garbage Collection

### Q29: How does Garbage Collection work in Java?
**Answer:** The GC reclaims memory from unreachable objects.
- **Heap Divisions**:
   - **Young Generation**: Eden, Survivor Spaces (Minor GC).
   - **Old Generation**: Long-lived objects (Major GC).
   - **Metaspace**: Class metadata (post-JDK 8).
- **GC Roots**: Threads, static variables.

---

### Q30: What’s the difference between Heap and Stack memory?
**Answer:**
- **Heap**: Dynamic allocation for objects (`new`), managed by GC.
- **Stack**: Static allocation for local variables and method calls, popped off after execution.

---

## 10. Maven

### Q31: What are Maven’s default lifecycles and key phases?
**Answer:**
- **Lifecycles**: Clean, Default (Build), Site.
- **Key Phases**:
   - `compile`: Compiles code.
   - `test`: Runs unit tests.
   - `package`: Creates JAR/WAR.
   - `install`: Adds to local repository.

---

## 11. Best Practices

### Q32: What are high cohesion and loose coupling?
**Answer:**
- **High Cohesion**: A module has one focused responsibility.
- **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact via interfaces, not implementations.
- **Best Practices**: Use DI, follow SOLID, prefer abstractions.
