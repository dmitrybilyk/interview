# Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed language developed by JetBrains. It
runs on the JVM, can be compiled to JavaScript or native code, and is
fully interoperable with Java.

## Key Features

1. **Java Interoperability**  
   Fully interoperable with Java, allowing seamless integration with
   existing Java libraries and frameworks.

2. **Concise Syntax**  
   Reduces boilerplate code with features like type inference, default
   parameters, and data classes.

3. **Null Safety**  
   Prevents `NullPointerException` with built-in null safety using `?` for
   nullable types.

4. **Functional Programming**  
   Supports lambdas, higher-order functions, and immutability.

5. **Extension Functions**  
   Extends existing classes with new functionality without modifying their
   source code.

6. **Coroutines**  
   Provides native support for asynchronous programming with lightweight
   coroutines.

7. **Data Classes**  
   Automatically generates useful methods (`toString()`, `equals()`,
   `hashCode()`, `copy()`) for classes designed to hold data.

8. **Multiplatform Support**  
   Allows code sharing across platforms (JVM, Android, JavaScript, Native).

9. **Android Development**  
   Preferred language for modern Android app development.

## Common Use Cases

- **Android App Development**: Preferred language for building Android apps.
- **Web Development**: Compiles to JavaScript for web applications.
- **Server-side Development**: Used with frameworks like Ktor and Spring.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Kotlin Multiplatform for shared code.


Notes:
- no semicolon is required at the end of rows
- main method without args required
- **var** and **val**
- not required to set type of reference variable
- templates with $ instead of String concatenation
- smart cast (after checking type)
- default arguments and named parameters
- null safety (for nullable language enforces null checks)
