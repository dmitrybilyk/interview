# Java NIO vs Traditional I/O

## NIO Key Features
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Perform I/O without waiting for operations to finish.
- **Selectors**: Handle multiple connections with a single thread.
- **Buffers**: Data is stored in buffers, improving I/O efficiency.
- **Channels**: Bi-directional I/O streams, faster than traditional streams.
- **Memory-mapped files**: Efficiently handle large files.
- **Asynchronous operations**: Supports async file and socket I/O.
- **File locking**: Provides file locking for safe concurrent access.

## When to Use NIO
- **High-performance servers**: For handling many connections concurrently.
- **Large file processing**: Use memory-mapped files for better performance.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: When you need non-blocking operations.

## When to Use Traditional I/O
- **Simple I/O**: For small, basic read/write operations.
- **Blocking behavior is acceptable**: For single-user applications.
