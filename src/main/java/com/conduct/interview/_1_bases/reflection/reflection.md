# Java Reflection

Java Reflection is a powerful feature that allows a program to inspect and
manipulate its own structure and behavior at runtime. It is commonly used for:

- **Inspecting Classes**: Finding information about methods, fields, constructors,
  and annotations of a class.
- **Instantiating Objects**: Dynamically creating objects of a class during
  runtime.
- **Accessing/Modifying Fields and Methods**: Manipulating private and public
  fields or methods, bypassing normal access control.
- **Working with Annotations**: Retrieving metadata attached to classes, methods,
  and fields.

Can be useful in implementing frameworks, testing libraries, 
serialization/deserialization libraries, inspection tools, inspection tools, AOP etc.

## Key Classes in Java Reflection

1. **Class<?>**: Represents a class or interface and is the starting point for
   reflection.
   ```java
   Class<?> clazz = MyClass.class;  // Getting class info
   
2. Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField("name");
3. Method method = clazz.getMethod("doSomething");
4. Constructor<?> constructor = clazz.getConstructor();

Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.example.MyClass");
Constructor<?> constructor = clazz.getConstructor();
Object myObj = constructor.newInstance();
