# Common Java Multithreading Issues

### 1. Race Conditions
- **Issue**: Threads access shared resources without synchronization.
- **Solution**: Use `synchronized`, locks, or atomic classes.

### 2. Deadlocks
- **Issue**: Threads wait on each other, causing a stuck state.
- **Solution**: Avoid nested locks or use `tryLock()`.

### 3. Livelock
- **Issue**: Threads respond to each other without making progress.
- **Solution**: Use retry strategies with increasing wait times.

### 4. Thread Starvation
- **Issue**: High-priority threads block lower-priority ones.
- **Solution**: Use fair locks and avoid priority-based threading.

### 5. Context Switching Overhead
- **Issue**: Frequent thread switching degrades performance.
- **Solution**: Minimize thread count and use thread pools.

### 6. Memory Consistency Errors
- **Issue**: Threads see inconsistent shared variable values.
- **Solution**: Use `volatile` or synchronized access.

### 7. Incorrect use of `wait()`/`notify()`
- **Issue**: Misuse leads to missed signals or unexpected waking.
- **Solution**: Use `wait()`/`notify()` within synchronized blocks.

### 8. Blocking Operations
- **Issue**: Threads blocked by I/O hold resources too long.
- **Solution**: Use non-blocking I/O or async mechanisms.

### 9. Thread Leaks
- **Issue**: Threads created but not terminated cause resource leaks.
- **Solution**: Shut down thread pools and manage lifecycles.

### 10. Improper Thread Pool Use
- **Issue**: Too few or too many threads in a pool impacts performance.
- **Solution**: Choose suitable thread pool sizes.

### 11. Concurrency Bugs in Data Structures
- **Issue**: Concurrent data structure use causes issues.
- **Solution**: Use thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`.

### 12. Out-of-Order Execution
- **Issue**: Threads observe operations in unexpected order.
- **Solution**: Use `volatile` or synchronization for memory ordering.

### 13. Fork/Join Pool Misuse
- **Issue**: Task imbalance leads to poor performance.
- **Solution**: Divide tasks evenly and follow Fork/Join patterns.
