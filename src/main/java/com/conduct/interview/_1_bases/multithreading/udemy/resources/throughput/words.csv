Thank
you
my
dear
She
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
They
were
silent
for
a
while

As
I
was
saying
to
you
Andrew
be
kind
and
generous
as
you
always
used
to
be
Don’t
judge
Lise
harshly
she
began
She
is
so
sweet
so
goodnatured
and
her
position
now
is
a
very
hard
one

I
do
not
think
I
have
complained
of
my
wife
to
you
Másha
or
blamed
her
Why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
