In Java multithreading, several common problems can arise:

1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads access shared data simultaneously, causing
   unexpected behavior due to non-deterministic order of execution.

2. **Deadlock**: Threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources,
   leading to an indefinite halt.

3. **Starvation**: A thread is continuously denied CPU time or resources, causing
   it to never execute.

4. **Livelock**: Threads keep changing states but fail to make progress, yielding
   without advancing.

5. **Thread Interference**: Threads modify shared data in conflicting ways, leading
   to corrupted results.

6. **Memory Consistency Errors**: Threads see inconsistent versions of shared data
   due to lack of synchronization.

7. **Overhead**: Excessive threads or context switching causes performance issues
   and resource contention.

8. **Improper Synchronization**: Using synchronization incorrectly can cause
   performance issues or data inconsistencies.

9. **Priority Inversion**: A low-priority thread holds a resource needed by a
   higher-priority thread, causing delays.

To mitigate these, Java offers synchronization tools like `synchronized`,
`ReentrantLock`, `volatile`, and `java.util.concurrent` utilities.
