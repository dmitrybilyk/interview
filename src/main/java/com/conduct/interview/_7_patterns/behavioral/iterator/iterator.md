The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides 
a standard way to access elements of a collection object sequentially 
without exposing the underlying details of its implementation. 
This pattern is particularly useful when you want to separate 
the collection's structure from the traversal logic, 
making the code more flexible and maintainable.
