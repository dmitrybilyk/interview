The ***Template Method*** Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm 
in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps 
without altering the algorithmâ€™s overall structure. This promotes 
code reuse and consistency while enabling flexibility in implementation 
details where needed.
