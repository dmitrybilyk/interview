### Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern defines an object that controls how a set of objects
interact. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they
use a mediator, reducing the dependencies between objects and promoting
loose coupling. This makes the system easier to maintain and modify.

#### Key Points:
- Centralizes communication between objects.
- Reduces direct dependencies between components.
- Encourages loose coupling in complex systems.
