The **Chain of Responsibility** is a behavioral design pattern that allows a
request to pass through a chain of handlers. Each handler can either process
the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern provides
a way to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver and enables
multiple objects to potentially handle the request, allowing flexible and
dynamic request processing.
