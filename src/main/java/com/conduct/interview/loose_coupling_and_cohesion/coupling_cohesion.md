## 🔗 Loose Coupling

Loose coupling means that components or classes are independent and interact through 
well-defined interfaces. This makes the system more flexible, easier to maintain 
and allows changes without affecting other parts.

## 🧩 Cohesion

Cohesion refers to how closely related the functions within a single class or module are.  
High cohesion means a class is focused on one specific task, making it easier to understand 
and reuse.
