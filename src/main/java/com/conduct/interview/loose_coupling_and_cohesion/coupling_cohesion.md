## ðŸ”— Loose Coupling

Loose coupling means that components or classes are independent and interact through well-defined interfaces.  
This makes the system more flexible, easier to maintain, and allows changes without affecting other parts.

## ðŸ§© Cohesion

Cohesion refers to how closely related the functions within a single class or module are.  
High cohesion means a class is focused on one specific task, making it easier to understand and reuse.
