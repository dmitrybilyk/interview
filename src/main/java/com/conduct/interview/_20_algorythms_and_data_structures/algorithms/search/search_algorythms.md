Linear Search: just goes one by one till the end until finds.
Binary Search: on sorted array divides to 2 parts and search 
then in one of them.
Ternary Search: Similar to Binary but divides to 3 parts.
Fibonacci Search: Divides into none-equal parts.
Jump Search: Not to go one by one but to make some bigger steps

There 2 two types of complexity measures:
- time complexity - how much time it will take
- space complaxity - how much memory it could consume

Measured as: O(1), O(n), O(n2) etc.

Binary search is considered as the best searching algorithm. It 
implements `divide anc cocuir` principle.
