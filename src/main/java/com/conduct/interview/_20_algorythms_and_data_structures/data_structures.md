A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data.
1. Linear data structures (element are placed sequentially, elements
have connections to other elements):
- static (fixed memory size): array;
- dynamic (size can be changed at runtime): stack, queue, LinkedList.

2. None-linear data structures (it's not possible to traverse the 
structure in single run): 
- graph (nodes and edges which connect them) 
- tree
-- `binary tree` with at most 2 child nodes
-- `binary search tree` - left child has value smaller than parent node and
right child has bigger value
-- `ternary tree` with at most 3 child nodes
-- `ternary search tree`
-- `b-tree` - binary or whatever tree with more complex keys of nodes
-- `red-black tree` - with black top node, balancing is guaranteed by the
additional bit reserved for the color
- hashing data structure
