- **Rich Standard Library**: Built-in support for networking, data structures, concurrency, etc.
- **Huge Ecosystem**: Frameworks like Spring, tools like Maven, and wide community support.
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Garbage collection handles memory cleanup.
- **Multithreading Support**: Simplifies concurrent programming.

Java is reliable, scalable, and widely used for enterprise, mobile, and web applications.
